// For the specific "Type instantiation is excessively deep" error on line 276,
// without seeing the full file content, I'll apply a targeted approach that's likely to fix the issue

// This type of error typically happens with:
// 1. Recursive types
// 2. Complex nested generics
// 3. Deeply nested component structures

// The solution is usually to:
// 1. Break the recursion with a type alias
// 2. Use type assertions to stop TypeScript from trying to infer types too deeply
// 3. Simplify the data structure

// For example, if it's recursive component props:
type SimpleAccordionItem = {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  content: any; // Using 'any' here to break potential recursion
};

// Then use this type to handle the deep instantiation:
// const accordionItems: SimpleAccordionItem[] = complexData.map(item => ({
//   id: item.id,
//   title: item.title,
//   content: item.content // No longer causes deep instantiation
// }));

// Without the full context, this is the best approach I can provide
